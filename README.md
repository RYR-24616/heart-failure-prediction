# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based predictive system that estimates the risk of heart failure based on a patient‚Äôs medical attributes. The goal is to assist early intervention by predicting the likelihood of a cardiac event using reliable medical data.

## üß† Project Description

This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict heart failure. It includes thorough data preprocessing, careful class proportion handling (especially for gender), model building using **XGBoost**, and detailed performance evaluation through metrics and visualizations.

Our model is trained on a publicly available heart failure dataset and aims to maximize both accuracy and interpretability for practical use in healthcare applications.

- Comprehensive preprocessing including:
  - One-hot encoding
  - Standard scaling
  - Controlled gender proportion for realism
- Model training using **XGBoost Classifier**
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Performance evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## üîç Problems Faced & Solutions Implemented

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Gender imbalance in dataset** | Instead of making it a strict 50-50 balance (which can distort reality), I adjusted the proportions while maintaining the original insight that **more males tend to die of heart failure**. This retained model realism. |
| **Model bias towards dominant classes** | Used `scale_pos_weight` and controlled undersampling to ensure fair training. |
| **Interpretability** | Plotted heatmaps and confusion matrices for better understanding of performance. |
| **Choosing the best algorithm** | After testing various models, **XGBoost** was chosen for its superior performance and efficiency. |
